# geofdev-s-custom-hwid-spoofer
Got bored and made a hwid spoofer for games, software, and fun. 
Creates a restore point (non-optional), then uses my custom program written in C to rewrite the bits that dictate the serial number of each piece of hardware.
This project is open source and currently working (Sep 14 2023) on Fortnite, Apex, Valorant, Pubg, Overwatch, Malwarebytes, and should work with most games/software.
I might maintain this depending on how much time I have to do so.
To use the HWID Spoofer you can download the source code as a zip and run it. It is just a bunch of uncompiled C files.
Use the .sln (rarely works)
Or download the compiled.exe which is confirmed to work and requires no setup.
